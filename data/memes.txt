climb Its impossible to rank up past diamond as a dps. It's the combination of long que times and shitty teams. I've seen literally 1 Masters dps player and he was duo queing with a Top 500 tank.

ranks Overwatches Ranking System IS SO F\*\*\*\*\*g Stupid. The ranking system in overwatch is abysmally stupid. It absolutely craps on the name of ranking system. When i play a game i expect consistency, not a half assed excuse for "SR". If you are reading this and are unsure of what im talking about let me help you. The first 5 rankings in the game are fine, as they all consist of metals and minerals, but then it takes a turn by introducing "Masters". Since WHEN could you mine MASTERS from an ORE. I HAVE NEVER FOUND MASTERS INSIDE OF A F\*\*\*\*\*G ROCK. This completely ruins the experience and brings the game rating down to a 4.
